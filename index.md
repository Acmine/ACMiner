## Pivot Introduction

This project targets at providing assistance to diagnose and fix fragmentation-induced compatibility issues (**_FIC issues_**). Pivot targets at learning valid API-device correlations from existing Android apps. Such API-device correlations could help app developers to reduce search space for FIC issues to APIs that can cause compatibility issues on specific devices.

On this page, we provide our FIC issue archive containing 17 real world FIC issues collected with the help of Pivot and video clips demonstrating inconsistent behavior of FIC issues.

### FIC Issue archive

All the information of our (currently) collected FIC issues are available in the [archive](https://github.com/FICIssuePivot/Pivot/issues).
